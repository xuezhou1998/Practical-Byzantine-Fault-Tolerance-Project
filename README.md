# Practical-Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance-Project

note:
we can make use of the code base of lab3 and lab4.
add test: we can add new test files into the folder: /Users/xuezhouwen/My Drive/NYU Courses/Distributed Systems/Practical-Byzantine-Fault-Tolerance-Project/apps/lab3/test

the script will automatically fetch the test file inside the test folder and run it.
